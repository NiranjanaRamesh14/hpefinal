1. The latency for read operations (readValue) has a significantly higher mean and standard deviation compared to write operations (writeValue), indicating potential bottlenecks in read requests.
2. Both IOPS for read and write operations show high mean values, suggesting overall good performance in terms of input/output operations per second. However, the narrower range between minimum and maximum values for write operations indicates more consistency.
3. Throughput for read operations (readValue) has a higher mean value compared to write operations (writeValue), indicating that more data is being read compared to written. The standard deviation of throughput for read operations is also larger, suggesting inconsistencies in the amount of data being read.
4. The queue length has a relatively high mean and median, with a slight standard deviation, indicating a moderate number of requests waiting in the queue on average. However, the range between minimum and maximum values is not large, suggesting that queue lengths do not fluctuate significantly.
5. No clear anomalies are observed within the given data, but further analysis may be required to investigate the higher latency and throughput for read operations and determine potential causes for performance variations.
