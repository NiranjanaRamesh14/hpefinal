1. The latency readValue (0.79 ms mean) shows a relatively high delay compared to writeValue (0.36 ms mean), indicating potential inefficiencies in read operations.
2. The IOPS for readValue (mean 70318.86, median 69894.00) is significantly higher than writeValue (mean 26210.00, median 26227.00), suggesting a larger number of read operations compared to writes.
3. The throughput for readValue (mean 1220993.28 KiB/s) is more than double that of writeValue (mean 681273.32 KiB/s), further emphasizing the higher number of read operations.
4. A higher standard deviation in readValue (latency: 0.15 ms, throughput: 107723.36 KiB/s) compared to writeValue (latency: 0.01 ms, throughput: 24010.47 KiB/s) indicates inconsistencies in read performance.
5. The queueLength value has a relatively high mean (38.43) and median (38.61), suggesting that the storage system may often be operating near its capacity or experiencing congestion due to high request rates.
6. No anomalies were found in writeValue performance, as all statistics are within expected ranges for a well-optimized workload. However, the relatively low max value (0.37 ms) might indicate that there is still room for improvement in the write operations.
7. In summary, the data suggests potential bottlenecks related to read operations with higher latency, IOPS, and throughput compared to writes, inconsistencies in read performance, and high queue length values. Optimizing read operations and possibly reducing the number of read requests could improve overall system performance.
