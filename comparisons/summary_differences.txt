üîç Week 1 vs Week 2:
In Week 2, there is a more pronounced imbalance between read and write operations compared to Week 1. The latency for read operations is significantly higher than write operations, indicating a possible bottleneck in read-heavy workloads. Additionally, both IOPS and throughput for read operations are much higher than their write counterparts, suggesting an increased emphasis on reading data. This could potentially lead to performance issues due to the system operating near its maximum capacity, as indicated by the mean queue length of 37.95.

Another notable difference is the consistency in latency response times, with lower standard deviations observed in Week 2 compared to Week 1 for all latency measurements. However, the higher standard deviation for throughput readValue suggests variability in transfer rates of read operations. This could indicate intermittent performance issues or resource contention during read operations, which may require further investigation.

In summary, Week 2 data shows a more significant imbalance between read and write operations, with higher latency and throughput for read operations compared to Week 1. The increased queue length also suggests potential performance issues due to the system operating near its maximum capacity. Further analysis is recommended to identify long-term trends, patterns, and any potential causes of performance variations in read operations.

üîç Week 2 vs Week 3:
Week 3 shows a continuation of some trends observed in Week 2, with certain metrics worsening or exhibiting more pronounced differences between read and write operations:

1. The latency for read operations (0.79 ms mean) remains significantly higher than that of write operations (0.36 ms mean), indicating a potential bottleneck in read-heavy workloads, as observed in Week 2.

2. Both IOPS for read operations (70318.86 IOPS mean) and throughput for read operations (1220993.28 KiB/s mean) are significantly higher than their write counterparts (26210.00 IOPS mean, 681273.32 KiB/s mean), suggesting an even more pronounced imbalance in write and read operations, as compared to Week 2.

3. The standard deviations for latency measurements show a slight increase for both read (0.15 ms) and write operations (0.01 ms), but the larger increase is observed in the standard deviation of throughput readValue (107723.36 KiB/s).

4. The queue length value has a slightly higher mean (38.43) and median (38.61), compared to Week 2, suggesting that the storage system may be operating near or even closer to its maximum capacity, potentially leading to increased latencies and reduced throughput during peak workloads.

5. In Week 3, there is a noticeable difference between the standard deviation of writeValue throughput (24010.47 KiB/s) and readValue throughput (107723.36 KiB/s), which was not as pronounced in Week 2.

6. In Week 3, no anomalies were found in write operations, but the relatively low max value (0.37 ms) for write latency remains an area of potential improvement in write operations.

In light of these findings from both Week 2 and Week 3 summaries, it appears that addressing potential bottlenecks related to read operations and possibly reducing the number of read requests could help improve overall system performance. Optimizing read operations, such as implementing caching strategies or fine-tuning read query optimization, may be beneficial for improving consistency in read performance and reducing latencies. Additionally, investigating possible causes behind the higher queue length values could provide insight into potential bottlenecks or congestion points that need to be addressed.

üîç Week 3 vs Week 4:
Week 4 shows an increase in latency for both read (0.74 ms to 0.79 ms in Week 3) and write operations (0.37 ms to 0.36 ms in Week 3), with a more significant rise in the latency of read operations compared to writes. This suggests that the potential bottlenecks in the reading process have worsened.

In terms of IOPS, the gap between read and write operations has widened from Week 3 to Week 4, with a higher mean for reads (78484.14 vs 70318.86) and a lower mean for writes (28153.00 vs 26210.00). This indicates that the higher volume or prioritization of read operations over write operations persists, but has intensified.

Throughput values have also increased from Week 3 to Week 4 for both read and write operations (read: 1278680.14 KiB/s vs 1220993.28 KiB/s; write: 691009.94 KiB/s vs 681273.32 KiB/s). However, the standard deviation for writes has increased (28112.74) compared to Week 3, suggesting less consistency in write data transfer rates.

The queue length mean value remains relatively steady at around 40, but the maximum value of 43.32 in Week 4 suggests occasional queuing delays that may contribute to latency or throughput issues.

In Week 4, an anomaly is observed in read operations where the maximum latency (0.94 ms) and max Throughput (1447237.11 KiB/s) are higher than their respective means. This indicates occasional spikes or inconsistencies in performance for reads that were not present or less pronounced in Week 3.

In summary, the data suggests that potential bottlenecks related to read operations have worsened, with significantly higher latency, IOPS, and throughput compared to writes, occasional inconsistencies in read performance, and high queue length values persisting from Week 3. It is recommended to further investigate read operations, consider the observed queue lengths, occasional write throughput fluctuations, and address the spikes or inconsistencies in read performance.
